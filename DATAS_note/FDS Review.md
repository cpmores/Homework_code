# FDS Review

## 1. Fundamental Conception

+ space and time conception

## 2. Stack and Queue

### 1. Stack

+ FILO
+ push, pop
+ How to complement preorder, postorder using stacks.

### 2. Queue

+ FIFO
+ push, pop, check if full.

## 3. Tree

+ node and layer, parent and children, n~0~,n~1~,n~2~
+ Traversal:

```
preorder, inorder, postorder
how to form and output the order,
how to form one order using other two order.
```

+ 递归及非递归
+  Forest and binary tree complement.

## 4. Heap

+ complete binary tree.
+ insert, delete, build
+ d-heap

## 5. Graph

- [ ] component, degree, connected, path
- [ ] adjacency matrix, adjacency list, adjacency multi-list, orthotropic list
- [ ] DFS, BFS.
- [ ] minimum spanning tree: Prim's algorithm and Kruskal's Algorithm
- [ ] shortest-path: Dijkstra Algorithm, unweighted shortest path.
- [ ] Topological Sort
- [ ] Network Flow Problem
- [ ] Critical Path
- [ ] bi-connected components

## 6. Sorting

- [ ] Insertion Sort, Shell sort
- [ ] Bubble Sort, quick sort
- [ ] merge sort
- [ ] heap sort
- [ ] radix sorting
- [ ] time and space complexity, stability

## 7. Hash

- [ ] hash function construction
- [ ] collision resolution:
  + open addressing: linear probing, quadratic probing
  + chaining 
  + double hashing
  + rehashing

## 8. Disjoint Set
