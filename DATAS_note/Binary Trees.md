# Binary Trees

## 1. Examples

+ Skewed Binary Trees
  + Skewed to the Left
  + Skewed to the right
+ Complete Binary Tree
  + the deepest and highest is no more than 1 level.

## 2. Properties of Binary Trees

+ The maximum number of nodes on level i is 2^i-1^ ( i>1 )
+ the maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of depth k is 2^k^-1, k>=1
+ For any nonempty binary tree,  n~0~ = n~2~ +1.

## 3. Binary Search Trees

+ Left is small, Right is large.

## 4. Implementation

### 1. Insert

+ check if this number is in the tree
+ find until we meet a null node
